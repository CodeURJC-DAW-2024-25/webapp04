### 👤 Olga Chubinova Bortsova
I was responsible for the filtering of products by categories and the search functionality. Additionally, I added AJAX to load more products on all pages except the main one. I was in charge of adding all the default initialized products. Furthermore, I developed the recommendation algorithm for the main page.

At the beginning of the project, I modified most of the templates to work with Mustache and created several models along with their controllers, service, and repository. Additionally, I fixed permission issues between user types, including editing and viewing profiles, among others.

### 👤 Marcos García García
I colaborated in the creation of the model classes and the definition of their dependencies for the database.

I was responsible for everything related to image upload, storage and display, as well as the Image model and its relations, needed for the correct storage of the images, and a way of getting the images from the database for display. I implemented this functionality for product creation and edition of multiple images, and for the user's profile picture. In addition, I developed the functionality for editing the user profile information (except for the map) and the rest of the products attributes. 

I developed the charts showing user stats (number of sales and purchases) over time and their style. Beside all this, I also made other changes and additions to the project such as some templates and styling, and other minor changes and fixes.

### 👤 Naroa Martín Simón
I have been responsible for implementing user registration in the application, ensuring a smooth experience by adding validation for the sign-in form both on the frontend and backend.

Additionally, I have managed users' favorite products, allowing them to add or remove items from their favorites section. I also set up the email notification system to alert users when one of their favorite products is either sold to another user or removed.

I have implemented the functionality to delete products, both from the seller's side and from the administrator’s side. I also implemented the whole account deletion process. This deletion process ensures that the sales and products already sold by the user remain intact, but other elements such as reviews, reports, and available products are removed when the account is deleted.

Furthermore, I have also managed the creation of sales/purchases in the application, ensuring that once a product is sold, it cannot be resold. Lastly, I have implemented the ability for users to view public profiles of other users, further enhancing the social interaction within the platform.

### 👤 Adrián Muñoz Serrano
I participated in the initial creation of the classes and the definition of their dependencies, as well as developing their respective repositories and a DataBaseInitializer with test objects to facilitate website testing. I implemented the login functionality, profile display, and logout. I also unified all templates related to products to improve design consistency.

On the main screen, I added a "Load More" button with AJAX, allowing products to load progressively in blocks of eight. I developed the selling functionality, enabling users to add products. Additionally, I implemented a chat system between two users to facilitate the purchase of a specific product.

I incorporated the option to report purchased products, with their corresponding display in the administration panel. I also developed the rating system, allowing buyers to rate sellers, with their scores visible both on the user's profile and in a carousel within the product details screen.

I added the option for users to set a location through an interactive map that generates an iframe when clicked, making it visible on both their profile and the product details screen. Finally, I migrated the project from the H2 database to MySQL.

# 📈 Product Display Algorithm
The algorithm used to display recommended products on the main page works as follows:
1. **Seller Ratings Calculation**:  
   First, the algorithm calculates the average rating for each seller based on the reviews they’ve received. If a seller has no ratings, their average rating defaults to 0.

2. **Rank Products by Recency**:  
   For each seller, the products they own are ranked by their publication date. The algorithm assigns a rank to each product, starting from the most recently published, and limits the ranking to the top 3 products per seller.

3. **Filter Unsolved Products**:  
   The algorithm filters out products that have already been sold, ensuring that only unsold products are considered for display.

4. **Sort by Seller Rating and Publication Date**:  
   Once the products are ranked and filtered, they are sorted in descending order by the seller's average rating. If two products have the same rating, they are then sorted by the publication date, with the most recently published products appearing first.

5. **Final Product List**:  
   The result is a list of products where each seller’s top 3 most recent unsold products are shown, prioritized first by the seller's average rating and then by the publication date.

This approach ensures that users see highly rated products from active sellers while considering the recency of the product listings.

### 🖥️ Documentation for deploying on the virtual machine
To deploy the application on the virtual machine provided by the university, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to a machine with an internet connection and SSH (Secure Shell) installed. This is standard on most Linux and MacOS systems, and available on Windows through tools like PowerShell or Git Bash.
- You must be connected to the university's network directly or via MyApps to access the virtual machine.
- Make sure you have the private key (`appWeb04.key`) downloaded on your local machine and have set the appropriate permissions. Windows users may need to adjust permissions by following the guides provided in these links: [Microsoft vscode-remote release issue #1619](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/1619#issuecomment-760990038), [Anuj Varma's SSH on Windows guide](https://www.anujvarma.com/ssh-on-windows-permissions-for-private-key-too-open/).

### Deployment Steps
1. Open a terminal on your system and use the following command to connect to the virtual machine.
   ```
   ssh -i ssh-keys/appWeb04.key vmuser@10.100.139.229
   ```
   Also it can be done with: 
   ```
   ssh -i ssh-keys/appWeb04.key vmuser@appWeb04.dawgis.etsii.urjc.es
   ```

2. Clone the repository in the virtual machine with the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CodeURJC-DAW-2024-25/webapp04
   ```

3. Navigating to the Directory Containing docker-compose.yml:
   ```
   cd webapp04/Docker/
   ```

4. Deploying the Application with Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. The application will be accesible in the following URL: [https://appweb04.dawgis.etsii.urjc.es:443](https://appweb04.dawgis.etsii.urjc.es:443)

6. To stop the deployment, run the following command:
   ```
   docker compose down
   ```

### 🌐 URL App (Deployment on Virtual Machine)
